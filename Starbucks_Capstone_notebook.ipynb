Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner. Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used to complete the project are cited and referenced.\n",

    "### GitHub Repository\n",
    "Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. If the student submits a web app rather than a blog post, then the Project Definition, Analysis, and Conclusion should be included in the README file, or in their Jupyter Notebook. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "Code is formatted neatly with comments and uses DRY principles. A README file is provided that provides. PEP8 is used as a guideline for best coding practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices from software engineering and communication lessons are used to create a phenomenal end product that students can be proud to showcase!"
